# 🛠️ Personal Python Tools

A growing collection of small Python scripts I use to support my development workflow, automate small tasks, or track project progress more clearly.

Each script is built for personal use and integrated into how I work in Obsidian, GitHub, or daily dev routines.

## 📄 DevLog ID Generator

Generates consistent, timestamped development log IDs.

### 🔍 Purpose
I use this to label dev notes in Obsidian and match them with related code commits or files. It makes it easier to trace back what I was thinking or doing when looking at code later.

### 🧪 Example Outputt
DEV_2025_07_13_01

Each ID includes:
- A `DEV_` prefix
- Date stamp
- Running counter for the day

### 📦 Status
✅ Working and in use  
🔧 Will expand with CLI arguments later (e.g. custom prefix, date format)

More tools coming soon. This repo grows as I automate and tinker.
